# Azure Quantum Developer Workshop 3 Demo
The project for exercise 2 of the Azure Quantum Developer Workshop 3 (https://microsoftevent.eventbuilder.com/event/45591).
This exercise asks you to find a bug in a Q# application that solves a modular equation ax + b = 0 (mod c) using Grover's search algorithm.

> Note that the first version of this project contained deliberately incorrect code and failing unit tests. This was part of the exercise at AQDW3!
